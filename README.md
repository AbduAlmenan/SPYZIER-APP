## **ABOUT THIS APP**

Introducing,  **_SPYZIER_**  a fast, intuitive and one of the compatible Android monitoring software programs that’s personified to meet all the digital safety challenges of your child . It lets you retrieve extensive details relating to the monitored device without blowing your cover. And it doesn’t even require you to **ROOT** or **JAILBREAKING** the device. The app can be used to track location, contacts, call logs, text messages, and much more. 


Advanced features such as  **INSTANTANEOUS SCREENCAPTURE**,**CALL LOGS** , **MESSAGING LOGS**,**LIVE LOCATION**,**LIVE GPS TRACKING** and others make it a valuable solution for parents who want to monitor their children’s itsy-bitsy details of their cell phone use. The best part is this efficient Android monitoring software of 2019 stays 100 percent invisible on the target device as the app icon disappears once you install it on the desired device.



This ensures the app keeps running in the background at all times. Getting the app installed on the device is relatively easy. Once installed, the app begins to collect information without ado. You can monitor on calls, text messages, call logs , remotely control the device as well as installed apps.
